# TEA Encryption and Decryption

This project demonstrates the encryption and decryption of an image using the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in Electronic Codebook (ECB) and Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) modes. The project is implemented in Python and uses the following libraries:

- Pillow (PIL) for image processing
- NumPy for array manipulation
- matplotlib for displaying images

## Running the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Install the required libraries using pip:

2. Run the main.py script:

3. When prompted, enter the key and IV in hexadecimal format (32 and 16 characters, respectively) and choose the encryption mode (ECB or CBC).

4. The script will encrypt the image using TEA and then decrypt it back to the original image.

5. The original, encrypted, and decrypted images will be displayed, and you can compare them visually.

6. You can also find the encrypted and decrypted images saved as Aqsa_encrypted.bmp and Aqsa_decrypted.bmp, respectively.
